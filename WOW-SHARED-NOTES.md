# WOW Shared Notes

Cross-cutting notes, routing caveats, and known limitations for the WOW v16 scoring pipeline that don't belong inside a single patch's review record. Append-only log, newest entries at the bottom.

## 2026-07-04 — skip_data_contract Routing Note

**Context:** During review of `WOW-PATCH-2026-07-04-MARKET-JOIN-AUDIT`, the market-join audit patch was approved and deployed as additive observability. It does not modify `market_gate.py`, `classifier.py`, terminal labels, approval thresholds, EV logic, or gate pass/fail behavior.

**Important routing note:**

`skip_data_contract` must not be used to bypass required validation in production scoring paths. It may only be used for controlled tests, diagnostics, or explicitly isolated internal tooling where the test objective requires bypassing the data-contract gate.

Production `/gate-engine/run` behavior should continue to enforce the data-contract gate before downstream market, projection, EV, and classifier logic.

Any future route, caller, or test helper using `skip_data_contract` must make the bypass explicit in the request/test name and must not be confused with a production-valid approval path.

**Status:** Shared note logged for future dashboard/gate-engine work.

## 2026-07-04 — /gate-engine/run does not forward skip_* flags over HTTP

**Finding:** The `/gate-engine/run` Flask route (`app.py`) only forwards `raw_rows`, `target_date`, `enrichment`, and `record_entries` into `run_pipeline()`. It does **not** forward `skip_data_contract`, `skip_health_gate`, or `skip_settlement_check` from the HTTP request body — those flags only take effect when `run_pipeline()` is called directly (e.g. from tests), never via the live HTTP endpoint.

**Status:** Known limitation, not a blocker. Logged here separately from the MARKET-JOIN-AUDIT patch per user instruction.

## Final disposition — WOW-PATCH-2026-07-04-MARKET-JOIN-AUDIT

- Market Join Audit: **deployed and active** (v16 active rule).
- Code/test acceptance: **PASSED**.
- Thornton/Gray historical replay: **not determinable from available logs** — no raw historical `/gate-engine/run` request body for that slate was found in accessible session history; do not treat any reconstructed replay of it as verified original data.
- Gate logic change: **none**. `market_gate.py` and `classifier.py` were not modified.
- Incident root cause: upstream market enrichment/join failure class confirmed (caller-side omission of market lines is consistent with observed `MODEL_QUALIFIED_HOLD` capping); the specific original payload's cause remains unresolved unless raw historical request logs surface.
- Future similar incidents: use the `market_join_audit` fields (`market_join_status`, `market_source_called`, `matching_market_found`, `market_rejection_reason`, etc.) to classify source-called/join-status/missing-field/rejection-reason directly from live or newly-captured payloads — do not reconstruct fake payloads to stand in for missing historical data.
